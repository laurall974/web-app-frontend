Hi Roch ! 

Congrats for being here.

I use the backend you provided I had a few lines to allow CORS. 
So you can use : https://github.com/laurall974/secure-web-dev-backend

To start you need to run the back : `npm start`

Then here do :`npm run dev` 

All the user story map are achieved : 
- US1: As a random visitor, I want to be able to register an account or log-in, so I can
access all features
- US2: As a random visitor, I want to be redirected to the login/register page when I click on “location" tab, so that I know I must log-in to see its content
- US3: As a logged-in user, I want to see locations and be able to click on one location to open a modal containing details, so that the website is useful
- US4: As an “admin" user, I want to see a “Add Location” button in the location page, so that I can create a new location
- US5: As an “admin" user, I want to see a button to edit locations in the array of locations, so that I can edit existing locations
- US6: As an “admin" user, I want to see a button to delete locations in the array of locations so that I can delete existing locations
